# What not to do

- In order to keep things neat & professional, here are some examples on what not to do when creating posts in the forum or when trying to fix an issue with someone.

## Extreme Unprofessionalism

</p>

- Mistake 1: The title dosen't explain anything about the issue this user is having
- Mistake 2: Posting the error message in raw text format. Discord supports markdown, and any competent developer is expected to use it
- Mistake 3: Mentionning the fact that he used ChatGPT to look for a solution instead of consulting forums or any other reputed website like Stack Overflow
- Mistake 4: Failing to provide any form of context on what his "poll" looks like. No code, not even a single screenshot in Discord of what his "poll" looks like

## Lack of Explanation

- Mistake 1: Failing to mention anything about his Contabo VPS. What spec is it, what OS is it running. This is very important in order to try and figure out why `dotnet build` is stuck.

- Mistake 2: Lack of understanding on the debugging features that the .NET SDK offers for example the `-v` flag for verbose mode. The author of this post could have used this to see where & why his build is failing. This could be a result of not knowing how to use the Linux Terminal and is something that can be considered

## Code Dumping with zero explanation

- Mistake 1: Dumping entire Slash Command code in without any single explanation of what it does. And in this context, this code is irrelevant because the issue is about Slash Commands not appearing in Discord, which could apply for multiple Slash Commands instead of just 1

- Mistake 2: Failure to conduct any testing. Has the author attempted to restart Discord, restart their IDE, test on a different system or test on the browser version of Discord.

## Cluelessness

- Imagine you are sifting through the forum for a solution. Do you think this is helpful???

- Mistake 1: Failing to provide a full solution before closing the issue. Once an issue has been rectified, it is important that it is shown how it was solved on the record, so that other people also can see how to do it as well

- Mistake 2: Using unprofessional language. Yes it slips out sometimes, but the impression you give others is important
