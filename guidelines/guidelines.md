**It is advised that you read these guidelines with great care to avoid breaking any of them and risk being reprimanded for doing so**

# __Guidelines__
- Please submit posts that are relevant to **Coding/Software Development**. Any irrelevant posts will be deleted immediately.

- Use the appropriate tag to label your post. If it is an issue, label it as an issue and nothing more.

- Submitting a post which simply **has your entire code** in it, proceeding to **asking for help** without any further elaboration, will be **deleted immediately**.

- Please do not send **irrelevant** messages which aren't related to the subject of the post.

- **Context** really matters, so make sure you provide as much relevant detail as you can about your issue, and your current situation on it.

- Please be **respectful** at all times when receiving help/assistance in this channel. Be **direct and straight to the point**, rather than getting yourself confused or angry during the conversation.

- If we find that you are using somebody else's code without their permission, that is an act of **plagiarism**, and will result in a ban if it is found anywhere in this forum channel.

# __Structuring your Issue__

- It is advised that you follow this general template on how you should structure your post if it is using the `issue` tag

## __***Title of Issue***__
- Introduce your issue at the beginning with 1-2 sentences. This gives us a good idea of the subject of your issue so that we know which areas to look in.

## __***Detailed Breakdown***__
**Explain your issue in the most detailed way you can. Don't be vague and lazy!!!**

- This is where you can now describe your issue in **as much detail** as you can. Do not hesitate to provide as many **code-blocks, screenshots, error messages ALONG WITH an appropriate explanation** of what is happening. 

- Please do not just dump your code and expect the person on the other end to fully understand it.

- If you encounter an error, please tell us exactly **where the error is & what you did** to receive this error and we will go from that basis to help you fix it.

## __***Any Testing/Debugging that was conducted***__
- If you have already tried to fix the issue, **tell us what you have tried** to do. Because this gives us a picture of what you have attempted to do to fix the issue.

- Give us detail on any **testing/debugging** you have done, what line is your code failing on, what variable is not functioning properly, what libraries are you using etc etc. The more detail you give us, the easier we can paint the picture of this issue.

# __Additional Guidelines__

## __General Tips to help format your issue__

- If you want to post code in your post, consider using **code-blocks** instead of sending a picture or even worse, raw text. If you do not know how to send a code-block, you have to use **3 backticks, before & after your code**, for example:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello, world");
```
*(You can also put the name of the language, Eg: csharp, after your first 3 backticks to colour code your code-block in that language)*

- Consider using **PasteBin** (or other alternative website) to show code that **exceed** Discord's character limit.

- Websites like **Stack Overflow, Reddit, GitHub Discussions** or even existing posts in this channel, may already have solutions to your issues before you even submit one, so be sure to check as much as you can for a solution before you feel like you need to submit a post.

## __Rectified/Completed Posts__
- Once an issue has been rectified the moderators will close your post. Please **do not re-open these posts** unless you have further issues with your existing submissions.

- In addition to this, please provide a **full solution** if you were the one to fix your issue, instead of the person on the other end. Saying stuff like **"Fixed it thx", "Nvm I fixed it"** or anything along those lines seriously doesn't help people trying to look here for solutions.

- If you have a new issue, **submit a new post** instead of reopening your older posts.
